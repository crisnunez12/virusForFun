So, this is a virus that I made for fun.
What it does, is to add an entry in your regedit, that makes it turn itself on windows startup, meaning that everytime you restart your computer, the "virus" will count one more of its executions, or, if you execute it manually, it'll as well.
In conclusion, what it's supposed to do (and it does) is that once the file was executed three times, it'll launch a "fake" virus reaction, moving your mouse a little, then showing a message box.
After that, it'll pretend to be keylogging your input, and it will, but it won't be sent anywhere, because there is no socket application innit, meaning, that all the information you input, will be left inside your own computer.
In this case, what I did, is save the first 100 characters you write in a text file, every time after the program is run, meaning that you'll basically have a "100 character temporal keylogger", that won't be sent anywhere, but instead will stay on a .txt file, in the SAME folder that you had the "virus" execute in.

This was made just for fun, and I hope you can check the code!
